# Packet Response Display Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for displaying packet sending results (ping and HTTP requests) in the WSLNetMan UI.

## Requirements
1. Display ping results in a clear, readable format
2. Display HTTP request results with status code, headers, and body
3. Show raw output for both types of requests
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Update the UI in real-time as results come in

## Ping Response Display
For ping results, we'll display:
- Destination IP/hostname
- Number of packets transmitted
- Number of packets received
- Packet loss percentage
- Round-trip time statistics (min, avg, max)
- Raw ping output

## HTTP Response Display
For HTTP requests, we'll display:
- Status code and message
- Response headers
- Response body
- Request duration
- Raw HTTP output

## UI Components
We'll need to add the following components to the packet sender tab:
- A text area for displaying ping results
- A tabbed view for HTTP responses with separate panes for headers and body
- A text area for raw output
- Clear and copy buttons for the response areas

## Implementation Approach
1. Modify the UI to include response display areas
2. Update the Rust code to handle response data
3. Connect the UI elements to the response data
4. Implement formatting for different response types
