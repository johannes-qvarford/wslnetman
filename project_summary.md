# WSLNetMan Project Summary

## Project Overview

WSLNetMan (WSL Network Manager) is a graphical tool for inspecting and troubleshooting network issues between Windows and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). The application provides a unified interface to view network configurations, firewall rules, routing tables, and Docker networks across both environments.

## Key Features

1. **Network Inspection**
   - View all network interfaces on Windows, WSL, and Docker containers
   - Display IP addresses and network labels
   - Show open ports with process information

2. **Firewall Rules**
   - Inspect Windows firewall rules affecting WSL networking

3. **Routing Tables**
   - Examine routing rules on both Windows and WSL

4. **Docker Networks**
   - View Docker networks running within WSL

5. **Packet Sender**
   - Send ping requests from specific network interfaces
   - Send HTTP requests over TCP from selected networks
   - View responses from sent packets

## Technical Architecture

### Programming Language and Framework
- **Language**: Rust
- **GUI Framework**: Slint
- **Build System**: Cargo

### Core Components

1. **UI Layer**
   - Built with Slint declarative language
   - Tabbed interface for different inspection tools
   - Interactive widgets for data visualization

2. **Network Inspection Modules**
   - Platform-specific implementations for Windows and WSL
   - System command execution and API usage
   - Data parsing and normalization

3. **Packet Sending Module**
   - Ping implementation using ICMP
   - HTTP over TCP implementation using reqwest
   - Network interface selection and binding

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Git repository
- [x] Create project documentation (README, LICENSE)
- [ ] Create Cargo.toml with dependencies
- [ ] Set up directory structure
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: UI Development
- [ ] Design main UI layout with Slint
- [ ] Implement network widget
- [ ] Implement firewall rules widget
- [ ] Implement routing rules widget
- [ ] Implement Docker networks widget
- [ ] Implement packet sender widget

### Phase 3: Backend Implementation
- [ ] Implement Windows network discovery
- [ ] Implement WSL network discovery
- [ ] Implement Docker network discovery
- [ ] Implement firewall rules inspection
- [ ] Implement routing rules inspection
- [ ] Implement packet sending functionality

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Connect UI to backend functionality
- [ ] Implement data refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Test on Windows and WSL
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Dependencies

### Rust Crates
- slint: GUI framework
- tokio: Async runtime
- reqwest: HTTP client
- serde: Serialization
- nix: Unix APIs

   - Real-time data updates
   - Export functionality for reports

3. **Platform Support**
   - Native Linux support
   - macOS support
   - Mobile companion app

## Conclusion

WSLNetMan will provide a comprehensive solution for diagnosing and troubleshooting network issues in WSL environments. By combining the power of Rust with the simplicity of Slint, the application will offer a responsive, cross-platform GUI tool that makes network troubleshooting accessible to both beginners and experienced users.
